When learning, there are always new things to try. And when compared to many other first tries, Storm Chaser holds up surprisingly well: the art, music, and programming was mostly done on my own and it does come together into a relatively polished final product.</p><p id="e20a7f6c-123c-49bf-9eb3-6113cff4939d" class="">

Hiding within the PlayerMovement class was a monolithic fixed-update loop handling sliding, jumping, movement, and collision. </p></div></div><p id="f77c2020-b247-40bc-ad64-91ce2a904f7e" class="">Despite the several instances of poor code cleanliness, the code does what it needs to: make the player feel smooth to control. The variable-jump height in particular was very important to the game feel, considering it is one of your only options for avoiding death in the game. I think this also helped set it apart from the other 2D platformer entries in the game jam.</p><h2 id="19b4f490-59ca-4497-aa7e-81f222de0269" class="">Music</h2><div id="7e55e70b-89ea-4ebf-8f00-edec35d99095" class="column-list"><div id="033fcaff-c209-4792-bde5-e470c8d96a4a" style="width:43.75%" class="column"><figure id="603a30cc-96a8-4996-b491-a08e4baf9324" class="image"><a href="Storm%20Chaser%207fba5afacbae4db8a03e17b45dc04951/Untitled%203.png"><img style="width:336px" src="Storm%20Chaser%207fba5afacbae4db8a03e17b45dc04951/Untitled%203.png"/></a><figcaption>The Storm Chaser FMOD Project</figcaption></figure></div><div id="9762c90a-798c-4e7f-b60e-00d7aa042f27" style="width:56.25%" class="column"><p id="35df4891-15b4-4d57-84c5-b6f0c788c59c" class="">One thing that I was particularly proud of about Storm Chaser is the dynamic music. I didn’t have enough time to write a very long musical track for the game, so instead I wrote a short one with several layers that would fade in and out. I imported these layers into a tool called FMOD and was able to fade them in according to the player’s progress in-game. I feel like it adds a lot to the progression of each level, and complements the build in difficulty as you progress through the level.</p></div></div><h2 id="60f4048c-5337-4ec2-9eec-390344fb7e82" class="">Difficulty</h2><p id="42af3a16-be95-4e35-9277-da68d6e219fb" class="">A quick note about the difficulty of this game - the “hard” mode is brutally hard. The fact that you can change the difficulty to “easy” makes that game playable, but still very difficult. Most of the difficulty comes at the end of the level: the obstacle spawner is programmed to speed up the further you get into the level, and the level design pushes you head-first into an upward climb against an oncoming wave of death. To make matters worse, there are no checkpoints. </p><p id="7aca05f1-a3cc-4a04-9a80-308f9f71bc03" class="">

A longer level through a more interesting enviroment with checkpoints would have made a more accessable and fun experience.</p></div><div id="8ab71d8f-6e3f-403c-ae5c-20771e9829dc" style="width:50%" class="column"><figure id="2d72188b-9f5a-4d14-9cfe-87677fd7f24d" class="image"><a href="Storm%20Chaser%207fba5afacbae4db8a03e17b45dc04951/Untitled%204.png"><img style="width:125%" src="Storm%20Chaser%207fba5afacbae4db8a03e17b45dc04951/Untitled%204.png"/></a><figcaption>The game was originally supposed to have 3 levels: desert, beach, and hell.

The most important lesson was about project scope - I simply did not have enough time to produce all of the assets and create as many levels as initially planned. Some concessions need to be made if you want to achieve the final vision you have for the project. The other lesson that I took away from this jam is that game development is fun. I really enjoyed the time I spent working on this project despite (or maybe because of) the difficult workload, and was inspired to continue participating in jams. </p><h3 id="89f3bd5f-e4db-44a6-b38f-f00f4d4f5649" class="">Addendum</h3><p id="c05ac859-9e9d-4e4b-8d79-c56cdafad606" class="">Here are some audio tracks that were not finished in time for the jam submission, but were intended to be put into the game.</p><p id="af14b5ec-46ca-46e0-8514-93b36f37fe14" class="">
